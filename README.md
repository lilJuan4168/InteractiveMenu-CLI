<h1>InteractiveMenu-CLI</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My very first python proyect, there are two versions beta_0.01 and beta_0.02, the objective is  learn about modularity and python classes.</br> It is a fastfood interactive menu, where you can choose between different options, you can see your selection in the shopping cart, and then it shows the total to pay.</br>
The version beta_0.02 is easily scalable.</p>

<h2>Run it</h2>
To run it just execute <b>main.py</b>, it works for both versions.
